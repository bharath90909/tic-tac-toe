# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to edit their names, take turns playing on a 3x3 grid, and determines the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Game Initialization**: A "Start New Game" button to reset the board and initiate a new game. Ensures that both players have entered their names before starting.

- **Game Board**: A 3x3 grid where players can click to place their symbols ("X" or "O"). Prevents players from selecting already occupied cells.

- **Active Player Indicator**: Displays which player's turn it is during the game.
- **Winner Announcement**: Determines and displays the winner when a player gets three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Displays a draw message if all cells are filled without a winner.
